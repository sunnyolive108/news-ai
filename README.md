# news-ai
I'm building an Ai that learns to nail the type of journalism needed  

### First basic ideas and necessities  
- scrapes the web / special pages for latest news (Ticker)
- translates them into bit sized, ready to post articles
- writes these posts and articles :  
    - into a file
    - into a scheduled post queue (or a message queuer)
    - into the media itself directly

      we'll see..
